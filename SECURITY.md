# Security Policy

We appreciate responsible disclosure and aim to fix security issues quickly.

## Reporting

- Please report suspected vulnerabilities via GitHub Security Advisories or by emailing the maintainers privately (rather than filing a public issue).
- Include as much detail as possible so we can reproduce the problem (version, environment, steps, expected vs. actual behavior).
- Do **not** include sensitive personal data in reports.

## Scope and support level

- Supported versions: the `main` branch and the latest published minor release.
- This is an open source project maintained on a best-effort basis; response times may vary.

## Handling of reports

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report.
2. We will investigate and, if validated, prepare a fix.
3. We will disclose responsibly, crediting reporters who wish to be acknowledged.

## Privacy note

SafeDOM.ai is designed for data minimisation and redaction, but it is not a guarantee of full anonymisation. Always review your integration and consult legal/privacy counsel.
